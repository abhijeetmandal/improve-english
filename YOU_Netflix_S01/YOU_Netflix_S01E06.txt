1
00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:01,862
Previously on "You"...

2
00:00:01,886 --> 00:00:04,720
Joe Goldberg? I heard
about you and Candace.

3
00:00:04,744 --> 00:00:07,676
She thought she could be
happier with some guy in Rome.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,756
Peach doesn't go anywhere
without that laptop.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,494
If only I could see inside.

6
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:14,585
Guinevere Beck?

7
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:16,685
This is the work of a sick mind.

8
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,520
She's obsessed with you.

9
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:20,889
She wants you all to herself.

10
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:24,726
It is exhausting being your friend.

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,561
I don't need to love
your self-absorbed poetry

12
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:27,896
in order to be kind to you.

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,165
Beck rarely knows what's best for her.

14
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:31,833
I couldn't agree more.

15
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,568
It's freeing, in a way,
to know for certain

16
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:35,270
what I have to do to protect you.

17
00:00:36,462 --> 00:00:37,732
Paco, what did you do?

18
00:00:37,756 --> 00:00:39,274
I didn't know how many sleeping pills

19
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:41,009
would knock him out.

20
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:49,551
Hey, you.

21
00:00:49,575 --> 00:00:50,919
Peach was attacked

22
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:53,355
in Central Park in broad daylight.

23
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:54,856
I'm headed to the ER now.

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,858
She's alive?

25
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:04,700
It's been three whole days
since I've seen you.

26
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:06,601
I failed you, Beck,

27
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:08,537
and this is my punishment.

28
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:10,605
Is this my walk to the gallows?

29
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:13,208
Should I be preparing last words?

30
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:16,138
Some humans, Beck, are cancer.

31
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:18,585
Peach is Stage IV metastatic.

32
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,289
I tried to cut out the mess
before it consumed you,

33
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:24,892
but now, best case, got to go in there

34
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:27,155
and win an Oscar kissing the ring.

35
00:01:27,156 --> 00:01:28,655
Worst case:

36
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:30,824
she knows it was me

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,951
and it's over.

38
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:37,108
Is this an ambush?
Will you love me in prison?

39
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:40,793
Hi.

40
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,035
Oh, no.

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,986
I can't believe I told you

42
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,854
to get involved
with your neighbor's shit.

43
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:51,856
It's okay. It's not your fault.

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,458
God, I've missed you.

45
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:54,659
How's Peach?

46
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:57,309
Oh, as well as can be expected.

47
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,465
Um, do you mind taking off your shoes

48
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:03,868
and anything that has touched
other people or the subway?

49
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,470
Sure.

50
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:28,015
How are you feeling, Peach?

51
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:33,431
I'm onto you.

52
00:02:33,845 --> 00:02:35,400
Hmm?

53
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:38,937
Is this it? The noose tightening?

54
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:41,573
You play the gormless
ne'er-do-well, and yet...

55
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:43,864
- And yet?
- It was you.

56
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:49,361
You're the one that warned me.
I have a stalker.

57
00:02:50,072 --> 00:02:52,050
Ha! Oh.

58
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:53,752
We're trying to figure out who it is.

59
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:56,021
You know, they say
most people are stalked

60
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,290
by someone they know.

61
00:02:58,314 --> 00:03:00,058
I mean, isn't that terrifying?

62
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:01,559
It's like I'm finally understanding

63
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,228
the dark side of celebrity.

64
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:06,003
This beauty blogger I know
is on her third stalker.

65
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:08,767
Becks, I'd love some more tea.

66
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,303
Oh, my shackled Cinderella,
if Peach gets her way,

67
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:12,389
you'll be making organic... Sure.

68
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:14,306
Concussion tonic until your beauty fades.

69
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,074
Oh, um, do you want some?

70
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:18,643
- It'll be good for your head.
- I'm okay, thank you.

71
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:20,064
You have pages due.

72
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:21,587
You have a boyfriend with a black eye.

73
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:23,537
None of this is okay.

74
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:29,810
Actually, I'm gonna...

75
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:34,993
Why is he here?

76
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,895
Hey, how long is she gonna stay here?

77
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,465
I don't know. Maybe indefinitely.

78
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,568
She's afraid to stay at
her house, which I understand.

79
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,972
They let her out
of the hospital pretty quick.

80
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:50,975
You know, like, three days?
I mean, it was a concussion.

81
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,751
I don't think she should be
your responsibility.

82
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:54,926
Hey.

83
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:58,123
When this is all over,
let's go away somewhere,

84
00:03:58,148 --> 00:04:00,259
just you and me.

85
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:02,095
I'm sorry to interrupt.

86
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:04,255
No, it's fine. What's up?

87
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:06,358
Just, you know, given everything

88
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:08,493
that I've been through,

89
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:11,529
male energy in my healing space just...

90
00:04:11,553 --> 00:04:13,362
isn't optimal.

91
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:17,635
Would you mind asking Joseph to leave us?

92
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:19,804
I think he heard you, Peach.

93
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:22,107
I don't need confrontation right now.

94
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:24,531
Oh, and have him take his gift with him.

95
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,508
I got to run some errands.

96
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:37,778
I'm sorry.

97
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:42,927
Uh, Beck, my tea.

98
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,602
Paris. Two tickets, first class.

99
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:09,058
I underestimated her.

100
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:10,597
She's not thinking about me at all.

101
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:13,258
She's busy making you all hers forever,

102
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:15,576
and I put you right in her pocket,

103
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,697
where you can't write, you can't love.

104
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:19,241
You can't be you

105
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:20,909
if you're living for Peach.

106
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,377
I won't let it happen.

107
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:24,168
I need a new plan.

108
00:05:27,073 --> 00:05:29,451
Because now

109
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,053
it's war.

110

111
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:48,926
Hey, Joe.

112
00:05:50,796 --> 00:05:53,442
- Oh.
- I'm so sorry, Joe.

113
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:55,144
It's okay. It's...

114
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:57,546
It's okay. We're good.
We're good, I promise.

115
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:59,822
Go inside, mi'jo.

116
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:10,926
Just a little something to say thank you.

117
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,427
It's specialty. Fudge brownies.

118
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:14,396
Oh, thank you.

119
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,095
It's kind of you to get involved.

120
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,232
I know things have been

121
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:19,301
a little bumpy here the past few weeks.

122
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:21,069
Try months.

123
00:06:21,093 --> 00:06:25,007
I just want you to know
that we're working on it.

124
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:28,644
So if you're thinking of
pressing charges or anything...

125
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:30,946
And expose Paco's little
chemistry experiment? No.

126
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,361
- Claudia.
- This whole experience

127
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:34,082
really did something to Ron.

128
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:36,185
And I know how it sounds,
but I feel like it changed him,

129
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,153
like he wants to do better.

130
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,511
People don't change.

131
00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:44,054
And I'm not gonna press charges.

132
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,556
Thank you, Joe.

133
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:48,485
I owe you one.

134
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,345
- Hey.
- I got a minute.

135
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:05,180
Peach is getting an IV vitamin treatment

136
00:07:05,204 --> 00:07:08,383
across town, but I wanted to see you.

137
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,352
Is everything okay?

138
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:14,623
Listen, I'm going away for a few days.

139
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:17,492
Peach's family has a place in Greenwich,

140
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:19,461
and she said she'd feel safer there.

141
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:21,330
I bet she would.

142
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:23,532
And what about school? What about us?

143
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:25,000
Joe, she almost died.

144
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:26,523
But not quite.

145
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:30,706
I know you've been through a lot,

146
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,741
but risking your future
for the same person

147
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:34,643
who tried to sabotage your career,

148
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,868
like, a week ago,
I mean, it's a little crazy.

149
00:07:39,605 --> 00:07:43,018
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

150
00:07:43,042 --> 00:07:45,509
But I'm always gonna be honest
with you, and honestly...

151
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:50,092
She's manipulating you.

152
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:51,660
Why in the world would she want to...

153
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:54,830
Because... you really can't see this?

154
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:57,666
If you become your own person,

155
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,323
she won't be able to control you.

156
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:03,171
I know that you don't want to hear it,

157
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:06,441
but the suicide attempt was a show.

158
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:08,377
She was never in any real danger.

159
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:11,179
Oh, so she just
attacked herself in the park?

160
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:13,081
No, no, I'm not saying that.

161
00:08:13,105 --> 00:08:14,916
Good, because the whole victim blaming

162
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,105
is starting to sound a little 4chan.

163
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:20,878
Yeah. I...

164
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,260
She's in love with you.

165
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:27,351
You know that, right?

166
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:34,636
- I got to go.
- Beck, no, I'm sorry.

167
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,271
- Wait. Wait.
- No, it's fine.

168
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:38,062
Thank you for being honest.

169
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:41,443
Okay, think.

170
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:43,712
Peach is taking you out of town.

171
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:45,781
But that's just a prelude.

172
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,449
She eases you into her world

173
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:49,618
and then snatches you away forever.

174
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:52,287
I'd follow you, of course,
but, Beck, I hate French food.

175
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:54,256
And you love New York,
and I need to save you.

176
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,091
My face is killing me.

177
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:57,979
Thanks a billion, Ron.

178
00:08:58,484 --> 00:09:01,730
Okay, Greenwich. That's where this stops.

179
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:03,732
Connecticut's Gold Coast,

180
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:06,001
land of hedge fund managers
and "Mayflower" descendants.

181
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,469
Shouldn't be hard to find you.

182
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:09,004
World gets a lot smaller

183
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,806
when you only have to search 1% of it.

184
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,076
And just like that,
the Internet gods provide.

185
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,744
Only an hour drive.

186
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:17,612
I love a mini road trip.

187
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:20,515
I used to take 'em
all the time with Candace.

188
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:24,453
It'd be nice to make new,
happier memories, actually.

189
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:31,193
If I'm headed into 1% land,

190
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:33,495
I'll need to look the part.

191
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,419
So thank you, Benji.

192
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,601
This is not how I lose you.

193
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:43,672
No hesitation this time.
This time, I finish it.

194
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:45,273
I'm coming, Beck. I'm...

195
00:10:25,437 --> 00:10:26,748
Candace.

196
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:30,051
Oh. Bunny.

197
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:32,743
You okay?

198
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:50,598
Morning.

199
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:53,168
- Morning.
- Car trouble?

200
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:56,938
- No, no, no, but I...
- License and registration?

201
00:11:58,564 --> 00:12:01,276
- I was robbed.
- Robbed?

202
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:03,385
By who?

203
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:07,137
Have you had anything to drink
this morning, Mister...

204
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:10,306
I need to think, or it's game over.

205
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,230
Oh, I'm sorry, Spencer Hewitt.

206
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,245
Can you step out of the car, please?

207
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,206
Okay.

208
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:25,688
Put your hands on the Buick, sir.

209
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,479
Take off your glasses, please.

210
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,790
You gonna tell me
what happened to your face?

211
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,783
Mm, morning Beckalíssama.

212
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,185
What are you doing?

213
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,987
Just eating breakfast. I was starving.

214
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,455
You don't eat any of this.

215
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,591
Just felt like carpe-ing
the Diem, you know.

216
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,626
When I was a kid, I used to come up here,

217
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,695
and my aunt would make
this massive spread.

218
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,631
And I don't know. I guess
I got inspired by the memory.

219
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,466
It's easy to forget sometimes.

220
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,101
You want to go to the mall?

221
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,970
Um...

222
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,772
you haven't shopped retail
since the Steve Madden incident

223
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,307
- freshman year.
- I know. I know.

224
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,008
I feel like slumming it,
and then we can get lunch.

225
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,944
I am craving pizza like a madwoman.

226
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,378
And then we can top it off
with a matinee.

227
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,047
- What do you say?
- I don't know.

228
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,448
It sounds like a lot.

229
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,983
I'm kind of tired.

230
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,518
That's my fault.

231
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,620
I've been a lot to handle lately,

232
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,055
and I want to make it up to you.

233
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,157
So why don't you eat your breakfast

234
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:37,493
and get dressed and then
let me spoil my best friend?

235
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,150
Now eat up.

236
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,000
Just kids.

237
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,869
They really kicked
the shit out of me, though.

238
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,705
Took my wallet and my wedding ring.

239
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:51,574
- Not your watch, though.
- No.

240
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,877
No, I got lucky, I guess.

241
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,679
Lucky he wouldn't know
an $80,000 Genevan timepiece

242
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:59,482
if it slapped him in the dick.
Thanks, Benji.

243
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,051
Apparently it doesn't
take brains to be a criminal.

244
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,553
Just balls.

245
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,221
Oh, if Opie's gonna bone me,

246
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,257
I wish he'd lube up and get on with it.

247
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,325
I'm gonna have to go run your plate.

248
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,160
Then I'll let you get home to your wife.

249
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,396
Must be nice to be married to a doctor.

250
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,586
Sure is.

251
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,657
You get out on the water much, Officer?

252
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,839
Yeah, you got the look. I can tell.

253
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,174
Listen, be our guest next summer.

254
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,543
The old man's bringing
the yacht up from Nantucket.

255
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,060
What model?

256
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,848
Azimut 62S.

257
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,481
The "Guinevere."

258
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,019
Quick little minx.

259
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,788
You see that? Contempt.

260
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:41,124
Opie just decided I'm a rich tool

261
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:43,359
and of no consequence
to the health and safety

262
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,928
of his jurisdiction.

263
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,352
He won't run my plates. You know...

264
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:51,768
Maybe you should just get home,
get some rest.

265
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:53,703
No rest for the wicked.

266
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,605
But I appreciate the concept.

267
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,006
Thank you so much.

268
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,530
Drive safe.

269
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:30,473
I'm just here to be close by
if you need me.

270
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:34,500
I don't trust Peach, Beck,
and neither should you.

271
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,314
This place is a castle

272
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:42,118
complete with wicked witch
and damsel in distress.

273
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,753
Guess that makes me your knight.

274
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,322
For you, Beck, yes.

275
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,694
Oh, I wasn't planning to break in,

276
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,664
but if you're gonna leave
the back door wide open...

277
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,639
Okay. Nobody home.

278
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,376
Oop, my head.

279
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,430
All in all, I thought it'd be worse.

280
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,706
I got a concussion once playing soccer

281
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,308
when I was 12. Puked my brains out.

282
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,411
Not fun but nowhere near enough

283
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,146
to keep me from my mission.

284
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,248
If anything, it means

285
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,050
I need to patch up.

286
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,449
Focus.

287
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,787
Get back in the game.

288
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:13,743
Oh, wow.

289
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:17,368
I'm so glad we got away
together like this, bunny.

290
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:21,206
This place is adorable.

291
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,587
I'm not leaving this bed

292
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,756
for the next 48 hours.

293
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,031
You in?

294
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:33,217
Oh, I'm in.

295
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,187
I love you, you know.

296
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,839
The spirit of the '90s
is alive in Greenwich.

297
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,741
I can't wait to see that dress on you.

298
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,676
You have to try it on.

299
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,446
It's so cold.
I think I'm gonna take a bath.

300
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,515
Oh, use the one in the master.

301
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,572
It has well-placed jets.

302
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,587
I like the claw-foot tub.

303
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,823
Of course you do, 'cause you're classy.

304
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,325
Cocktail? I'll get you one.

305
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:26,341
I want to give you a life
this grand someday.

306
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,043
God knows you deserve it. Darling.

307
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,544
I made you a Negroni.

308
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,479
Minus the unwanted pressure

309
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,637
from an obviously unstable
obsessed person, of course.

310
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,589
My hatred for Peach has
practically become sentient.

311
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,425
Now, take your time and relax, okay?

312
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,227
I've got a surprise for you
when you get out.

313
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,729
Oh, and don't forget to use
that geothermal mud mask.

314
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,531
- It is life-changing.
- Mm.

315
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,854
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

316
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,956
Look at that.

317
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,426
How dare she invade
your privacy like that?

318
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,894
It's perverse.

319
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,796
God, I have to pee.

320
00:20:43,148 --> 00:20:45,248
I'll double back for that.

321
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:50,180
How long is she going
to stand there staring at you?

322
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,135
Hello?

323
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,838
Anyone here?

324
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,725
- Who is that?
- Uh...

325
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,682
it's the surprise.

326
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,231
She has a gun, Beck.

327
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:06,801
She's not in her right mind,
and you know it.

328
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,770
I have to do something.

329
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,795
80% of gun accidents happen in the home.

330
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:23,017
Why is Peach dressing you up like a doll?

331
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,254
Okay, I'm wearing this ridiculous thing.

332
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,078
What's my surprise?

333
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,727
Oh, my God, Raj.

334
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,163
Hey, gorgeous. Long time, no see.

335
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,489
Can't wait to catch up, doll.

336
00:22:52,896 --> 00:22:55,508
I thought we said no phones.

337
00:22:55,532 --> 00:22:56,497
Sorry.

338
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,278
It's just my brother.

339
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:00,846
All right.

340
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,170
Let's duet.

341
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:06,385
You know any Sabbath?

342
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:08,921
Uh...

343
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:21,700
It's funny what sticks in your brain.

344
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:24,236
Sounds, a bit of song...

345
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,871
Give us one second, Raj.

346
00:23:25,895 --> 00:23:28,407
And now, I fear, this chucklehead's voice

347
00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:29,909
calling you gorgeous.

348
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:31,944
I knew Peach was an instigator,

349
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:34,780
and this is when her trap
starts closing in.

350
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:36,315
What the hell is he doing here?

351
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:37,950
I thought it'd be fun.

352
00:23:37,974 --> 00:23:39,151
What happened to you not wanting

353
00:23:39,175 --> 00:23:40,953
to be around male energy?

354
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:42,588
I feel much better now.

355
00:23:42,612 --> 00:23:44,090
Well, that makes one of us.

356
00:23:44,114 --> 00:23:46,559
You're still mad at me. I get that.

357
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,893
Do you?

358
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:49,895
I said your poetry was self-absorbed.

359
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,398
And I'm sorry my words hurt, but I...

360
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:53,799
But?

361
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:55,101
Hear me out.

362
00:23:56,793 --> 00:23:59,805
You are one of the most
talented people I know.

363
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:02,108
And I hate to see you
conforming to a system

364
00:24:02,132 --> 00:24:04,643
that is designed to crush individuality.

365
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:06,479
If you want to be a great writer,

366
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:07,913
you have to get out there

367
00:24:07,937 --> 00:24:09,615
and live a life worth writing about.

368
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:11,083
What do you want me to do, Peach,

369
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:12,852
live off the land?

370
00:24:12,876 --> 00:24:16,422
Cousin Inez finally
vacated the Paris flat.

371
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:18,157
I talked to my dad.

372
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:19,925
He said I could have it
and oversee the renovation.

373
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:22,294
She had a pet ocelot. There was damage.

374
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:25,097
Wait, you're moving to Paris?

375
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:27,989
We are moving to Paris, chérie.

376
00:24:31,828 --> 00:24:34,473
Peach, this is crazy. I...

377
00:24:34,497 --> 00:24:36,876
I don't need an answer right now.

378
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,146
Relax. I just want you to trip on it.

379
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,648
- Hence Raj.
- Look.

380
00:24:42,672 --> 00:24:45,673
Paris could be a new beginning
for the both of us.

381
00:24:47,544 --> 00:24:49,262
Say you'll think about it.

382
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:51,846
Don't do it.

383
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,682
Okay.

384
00:24:56,152 --> 00:24:57,652
Okay.

385
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:09,208
Ladies first.

386
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:13,245
Okay, to old friends

387
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:14,980
and new experiences.

388
00:25:15,004 --> 00:25:16,415
Cheers.

389
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,988
I haven't been this relaxed in weeks.

390
00:25:23,012 --> 00:25:25,324
Wait until that baby kicks in.

391
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:29,261
So what did we take
with utter blind trust in you?

392
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:33,532
Pure MDMA, slightest dash
of organically sourced opium.

393
00:25:33,556 --> 00:25:35,367
Well, way to go, Walter White.

394
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:37,570
I could never blame you,
Beck, not even for this.

395
00:25:37,594 --> 00:25:39,338
Peach is a master at her game.

396
00:25:39,362 --> 00:25:42,241
Step one, get you alone
in a secluded house.

397
00:25:42,265 --> 00:25:45,044
Step two, invite this Raj person over,

398
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:47,146
fill you with drugs,
and get you to cheat on me.

399
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,238
Step three, steal you away
to Paris forever.

400
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,621
Had to get everything put away

401
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:58,224
and tidy for Raj, didn't you?

402
00:25:58,248 --> 00:26:00,025
I need to find that gun.

403
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:05,931
So what have you been up to, Raj?

404
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:08,234
Well, you know, finishing up
medical school.

405
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:10,102
Wham, bam, get it done.

406
00:26:10,126 --> 00:26:12,404
What have you been up to, Guinevere Beck?

407
00:26:12,428 --> 00:26:13,539
Still writing?

408
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:14,907
You should read her poetry.

409
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:16,275
It's beguiling.

410
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:19,211
Honestly, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

411
00:26:19,235 --> 00:26:22,281
I thought I did, but lately
it hasn't been so clear.

412
00:26:32,015 --> 00:26:33,759
It was here.

413
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:35,761
I bet you're doing better
than you think you are.

414
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:37,796
Beck's just having
a little writer's block.

415
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,566
- It'll pass.
- I want to write a book

416
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:43,102
about an injured soul,

417
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:45,604
someone who doesn't feel like
they have a place in the world

418
00:26:45,628 --> 00:26:48,641
as we know it, someone on the outside.

419
00:26:48,665 --> 00:26:50,342
You should write about my stalker.

420
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:55,447
I love that.

421
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:57,171
I know you do.

422
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:03,789
Peach is playing with me.

423
00:27:03,813 --> 00:27:06,592
She knows I'm here. This is all a trap.

424
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:07,860
I sound crazy.

425
00:27:07,884 --> 00:27:09,461
Head injury. The car.

426
00:27:09,485 --> 00:27:10,963
I might be a little crazy right now.

427
00:27:10,987 --> 00:27:12,998
No, no, no, no, no. No, I'm not.

428
00:27:13,022 --> 00:27:15,768
I'm not. This is real.
She had a gun somewhere.

429
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,426
You're not safe.

430
00:27:20,463 --> 00:27:23,008
Raj, feel how soft this feels.

431
00:27:31,307 --> 00:27:33,619
It is soft.

432
00:27:33,643 --> 00:27:36,055
You smell good.

433
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,623
So do you.

434
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:05,684
Platonic massage train.

435
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:07,052
I call front.

436
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:09,321
I need a sec. I'm spinning out.

437
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:11,178
I got you.

438
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,998
Is this rock bottom?

439
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:23,335
Because it sure feels like it.

440
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,937
Do you see now?

441
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:28,273
I would do anything for you, Beck.

442
00:28:31,868 --> 00:28:34,446
I don't know why Candace
followed me here.

443
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,684
It's like I hit my head
and bad memories jolted loose.

444
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:42,688
It's a coincidence, Beck.
You and she are nothing alike.

445
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:46,225
Nothing. Or maybe you are.

446
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:48,293
I can't tell anymore.

447
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:50,229
How good does that feel?

448
00:28:50,253 --> 00:28:52,353
Oh, my gosh.

449
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:58,570
Beck, run.

450
00:28:58,594 --> 00:29:00,406
Can't you feel what she's doing,

451
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,029
what she wants?

452
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:06,734
Don't you want to run?

453
00:29:11,474 --> 00:29:13,741
Maybe you don't.

454
00:29:16,412 --> 00:29:19,725
Okay. Way too far.

455
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:21,427
- Yes.
- I said

456
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:23,962
- platonic massage train.
- Oh, Beck.

457
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:25,731
You're always so skittish.

458
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:29,968
Yeah, platonic means friends
just being friendly.

459
00:29:29,992 --> 00:29:32,671
Yeah, well, I have a boyfriend.

460
00:29:32,695 --> 00:29:36,408
Yes, you do, my perfect girl.

461
00:29:36,432 --> 00:29:38,277
Well, I don't.

462
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:40,646
- Me neither.
- I think I need to dance.

463
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:41,980
I'm gonna go dance.

464
00:29:42,004 --> 00:29:44,817
I feel bad for Peach, really.

465
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:47,653
It's tragic not to be able
to show who you really are,

466
00:29:47,677 --> 00:29:49,154
and it's turned her poisonous.

467
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:51,123
Oh, that feels good.

468
00:29:51,147 --> 00:29:53,192
Oh, okay, no.

469
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:55,194
- Yeah, a little lower.
- Oh, my.

470
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:57,830
I bet Harry never
had to do this for Sally.

471
00:29:57,854 --> 00:29:59,331
Yeah, mm. Mm-hmm.

472
00:29:59,355 --> 00:30:01,300
Okay.

473
00:30:01,324 --> 00:30:04,603
I have something.

474
00:30:04,627 --> 00:30:09,274
Hi.

475
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:10,943
- Hold on.
- Hi.

476
00:30:13,469 --> 00:30:14,813
I think I'm done being mad at you now.

477
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:16,136
Okay.

478
00:30:19,842 --> 00:30:21,487
Okay, be right back,

479
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:23,889
just gonna climb in from off this ledge.

480
00:30:23,913 --> 00:30:25,379
You're cute.

481
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,483
I really am sorry.

482
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:33,988
I know... Joe?

483
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:36,226
Yes?

484
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,946
I don't want to go to Paris.

485
00:30:41,264 --> 00:30:43,783
Note to self: no Paris.

486
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:46,044
Okay.

487
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:48,247
I know he's down here somewhere.

488
00:30:48,271 --> 00:30:49,503
Um...

489
00:30:51,107 --> 00:30:53,085
I swear it was here. I just used it.

490
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:54,253
Oh.

491
00:30:54,277 --> 00:30:55,576
Okay.

492
00:30:56,913 --> 00:30:59,057
Another thing I keep learning...

493
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:00,047
Yes.

494
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:03,829
Things can always get worse.

495
00:31:03,853 --> 00:31:05,264
All right, you want this?

496
00:31:05,288 --> 00:31:06,865
I don't not want it.

497
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:09,067
Okay. Here he comes. Big daddy.

498
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:12,070
Oh, Beck. I'm so boned.

499
00:31:12,094 --> 00:31:15,140
But not as boned as Raj is about to be.

500
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,565
Oh, God, that's interesting.

501
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:31,215
I feel like Colonel Kurtz.

502
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:33,551
An entire night of listening
to Peach Salinger

503
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:37,421
over and over and over
and over and over and over.

504
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:41,225
The horror. One thing got me
through the long night.

505
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:42,760
My mantra.

506
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:45,196
You miss me.

507
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,445
Packed already?

508
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:02,780
We don't leave for another two days.

509
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:04,281
Yeah, about that.

510
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:06,483
I'm going back to the city.

511
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,052
Good. Great.

512
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:10,309
You have stuff to wrap up and then Paris.

513
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:13,424
Okay, I've thought about it.

514
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:16,994
Thank you, but I belong in New York.

515
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,930
I'm not ready to give up yet.

516
00:32:19,954 --> 00:32:21,465
Give up?

517
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:23,767
I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.

518
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:25,169
I mean, do you want to be an artist

519
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,904
or an institutionalized cliché?

520
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:29,139
You're asking me to quit my MFA.

521
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:32,076
Leave New York, my friends,
my relationship...

522
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,845
Oh, good God, you've known
him for, like, five seconds.

523
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,914
- I'm just saying that...
- Okay, do yourself a favor.

524
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:39,783
Have some self-esteem and lose
the creepy retail loser.

525
00:32:39,807 --> 00:32:41,685
- Do we have to go there?
- I'm just being real.

526
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,354
Okay, you want to be real?

527
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,977
What was that last night?

528
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,414
- What was what?
- You kissed me.

529
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:53,185
We were all rolling.

530
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,767
You always do this.

531
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:59,336
- What? What do I do?
- Drama out of nothing.

532
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,472
I mean, you were really high.

533
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:03,607
You were leaning into me
and, quite frankly,

534
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:05,309
- being very initiating.
- What?

535
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:08,178
And I went with it because,
whatever, it was a party.

536
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:10,214
I didn't want it to be weird
because I'm your friend,

537
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,383
and that's what friends do.
That is not what happened.

538
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,551
Jesus Christ, Beck. Be an adult, okay?

539
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,287
- Take a little responsibility.
- Can we slow down?

540
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:18,188
I'm just saying...

541
00:33:18,212 --> 00:33:21,992
Shit, I'm trying to say I am your friend.

542
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:24,028
- So if...
- Jesus Christ.

543
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:27,298
I know your family. I know how they are.

544
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:30,401
- I know they wouldn't be okay...
- No. No. I'm sorry.

545
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,336
You have issues, okay?

546
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,238
Don't make your desperate unending need

547
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,839
for attention about me.

548
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:37,908
This entire conversation is insane.

549
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:41,211
Okay, can we back up for one second?

550
00:33:41,235 --> 00:33:43,314
I am not attacking you.

551
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:45,349
I came here to take care of you.

552
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:47,918
Of me? Oh, that's rich.

553
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,821
- It really is.
- God, Peach, you know,

554
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:53,357
Joe sees it too.
He's been trying to tell me.

555
00:33:53,381 --> 00:33:56,894
Course Joe's behind this.

556
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:59,663
Joe is trash.

557
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:01,665
Joe is nothing.

558
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:03,367
You're my family.

559
00:34:03,391 --> 00:34:06,070
I'd die for you. Would he?

560
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:08,394
In a heartbeat.

561
00:34:10,732 --> 00:34:12,176
I need a break.

562
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,677
And what?

563
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:16,046
Go slum it with the proletariat?

564
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,015
I give you a week.

565
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,605
My Uber's here.

566
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,086
So what?

567
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,253
You're just going to abandon me

568
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:24,588
when I need you the most?

569
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:26,457
What about my stalker?

570
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,193
I'll text you the number
of a private security company.

571
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:30,694
Call them.

572
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:33,364
I can't believe you.

573
00:34:33,388 --> 00:34:36,033
After all I do for you.

574
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:38,124
You just use people.

575
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,924
You are good.

576
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:01,593
Beck, you're medicine.

577
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:03,661
You are the antidote for liars,

578
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,131
and you make cheating a distant memory.

579
00:35:06,155 --> 00:35:08,733
And right now, I love you so much.

580
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:11,302
The ringing in my head is music.

581
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:13,171
Hey!

582
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,606
Give me my phone.

583
00:35:17,466 --> 00:35:20,645
- I don't have your stupid...
- I'm not cheating on you.

584
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:22,447
He's an A&R guy.

585
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:25,283
I have to seem available, okay?
It's just business.

586
00:35:25,307 --> 00:35:27,285
Business. We've been through this.

587
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:29,788
Yeah, we sure have.

588
00:35:29,812 --> 00:35:31,456
You're lying.

589
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,991
You cheated on me.

590
00:35:33,015 --> 00:35:35,360
You broke my heart, Candace.
I let you go.

591
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,795
Isn't that enough?

592
00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:38,329
There's something wrong with you.

593
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,498
I thought some time away
would mellow you out.

594
00:35:40,522 --> 00:35:42,534
But you're jealous. You're paranoid.

595
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:43,968
You need help!

596
00:35:43,992 --> 00:35:45,192
Give...

597
00:35:48,497 --> 00:35:49,607
Joseph.

598
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:05,140
Why are you in my house, Joseph?

599
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:07,142
Oh, I should have shot this Medusa

600
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,044
when I had the chance.

601
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:11,380
Peach, put the gun down. I can explain.

602
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:13,048
This is breaking and entering.

603
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:15,484
I'd be totally within my rights
to shoot you right now.

604
00:36:15,508 --> 00:36:18,754
I... I'm here picking up Beck.

605
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:21,412
Beck's in an Uber.
What are you doing here?

606
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:25,794
My God.

607
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:27,596
You.

608
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,053
What?

609
00:36:29,856 --> 00:36:31,400
You're my stalker.

610
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:33,736
Aw, I knew something was off about you,

611
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,437
and I was right.

612
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,573
How long have you been obsessed with me?

613
00:36:37,597 --> 00:36:39,074
Oh, don't deny it,

614
00:36:39,098 --> 00:36:40,576
you little shit.

615
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,112
You stole my "Ozma," you stole my laptop,

616
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,480
and at this point,

617
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:46,115
I'm convinced you
attacked me in the park.

618
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,017
Why... wait, why would I attack you

619
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,419
if I'm so obsessed with you?

620
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:51,987
I don't know how your twisted mind works.

621
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:53,288
'Cause you're sick?

622
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:55,090
You couldn't be more wrong.

623
00:36:55,114 --> 00:36:56,125
- Sorry.
- Oh, really?

624
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:58,160
Then why are you here, Joseph?

625
00:36:58,184 --> 00:36:59,868
Why are you here?

626
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,520
Peach, why are you?

627
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:07,125
Beck.

628
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:09,338
Oh.

629
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:11,940
This is about Beck, isn't it?

630
00:37:11,964 --> 00:37:14,309
I know what you said to her.

631
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,478
You got in her head.

632
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,447
Because you can't stand to share her

633
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:20,716
with somebody so much better than you.

634
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,418
I mean, you were just trying
to get me out of the way.

635
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,309
Oh, my God.

636
00:37:33,653 --> 00:37:36,153
Why are you wearing Benji's watch?

637
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:41,036
Why are you wearing Benji's watch?

638
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,404
You're right.

639
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:44,139
You're right. I stole your laptop.

640
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:45,707
I found all the files.

641
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:48,577
The ones you keep on your friends.

642
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:51,313
The ones with the naked pics of Beck.

643
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:53,715
Now, is that for blackmail

644
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,083
or personal use?

645
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,152
It's an impressive collection.

646
00:37:57,176 --> 00:37:58,420
I made copies.

647
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,155
Now, I have no plans to share,

648
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:02,524
but if anything happens to me,
my associate, Paco,

649
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:06,528
has been instructed
to publish all the files online

650
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:09,364
and send a link
to your entire address book.

651
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:12,568
And we can walk away from this.

652
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:14,592
Peach, we can...

653
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:18,662
We can... we can let it go.

654
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,545
- It never happened.
- And what?

655
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:26,048
We can go back to New York
and pretend to be friends?

656
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:27,783
- If you like.
- No.

657
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:29,852
I don't want you near Beck.
You're dangerous.

658
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:31,283
I'm better for her than you are.

659
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:33,357
Take the ticket, Peach.

660
00:38:33,381 --> 00:38:34,923
Go to Paris.

661
00:38:34,947 --> 00:38:37,960
Clear your head. Find a nice French girl.

662
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:40,295
'Cause you know, deep down,
she's never gonna love you

663
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:42,097
- the way you love her.
- Stop saying that.

664
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:44,366
She's never gonna do it.
You can't have her.

665
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,501
Stop saying that!

666
00:39:14,512 --> 00:39:16,178
Joseph?

667
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:52,017
Family, friends, lovers,
and all the rest,

668
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:54,052
forgive me for this.

669
00:39:54,076 --> 00:39:57,923
But it's not like you can say
you didn't see this coming.

670
00:39:57,947 --> 00:39:59,892
I've always had
a complicated relationship

671
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:01,493
with my own existence.

672
00:40:03,352 --> 00:40:05,230
I was given a second chance on life

673
00:40:05,254 --> 00:40:08,267
after the attack in the park, and...

674
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:10,836
I've decided not to take it.

675
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,604
I thought I could change

676
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:15,707
and, by changing myself,
alter the world around me.

677
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:19,278
But change is a fool's pipe dream.

678
00:40:19,302 --> 00:40:21,847
This world is ugly and crass.

679
00:40:21,871 --> 00:40:24,016
People lie, and people leave.

680
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,452
And the beauty that does exist
is fleeting and insincere.

681
00:40:27,476 --> 00:40:29,755
Still, every now and again,

682
00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:32,858
someone comes along who will
make you believe in love.

683
00:40:32,882 --> 00:40:35,193
And if you find that person,

684
00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:37,229
don't let go.

685
00:40:37,253 --> 00:40:40,866
And maybe together, you can
keep the monsters at bay.

686
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:43,035
I was never that lucky.

687
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:46,738
So I'm ending things on my own terms.

688
00:40:46,762 --> 00:40:49,408
Know that I love you all

689
00:40:49,432 --> 00:40:53,045
and hope we'll meet again
on the cosmic highway.

690
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:54,546
Stay amazing.

691
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:58,038
Love, Peach Anais Salinger.

692
00:40:59,976 --> 00:41:01,486
What could I do?

693
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,622
She was never going to let you go.

694
00:41:03,646 --> 00:41:07,159
- Dispatch to Nico.
- Go ahead.

695
00:41:07,183 --> 00:41:08,760
Ran that plate you asked for.

696
00:41:08,784 --> 00:41:10,896
Car's registered to an Ivan Mooney.

697
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,632
Address in Manhattan. Stolen?

698
00:41:13,656 --> 00:41:16,101
No. Not reported, anyway.

699
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,436
Thanks, Diane.

700
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:47,899
Well...

701
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,657
you said you owe me one.

702
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:54,640
You're lucky.

703
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:57,209
The bullet only grazed you.

704
00:41:59,835 --> 00:42:01,602
I feel lucky.

705
00:42:02,638 --> 00:42:03,815
You want to talk about it?

706
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,517
Not really, no.

707
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:07,052
If you don't mind.

708
00:42:07,076 --> 00:42:09,219
Mm. A favor's a favor.

709
00:42:12,481 --> 00:42:15,460
So I took your advice.

710
00:42:15,484 --> 00:42:17,462
I kicked Ron out.

711
00:42:17,486 --> 00:42:19,831
You were right. People don't change.

712
00:42:19,855 --> 00:42:22,868
Besides, I didn't like the way
he was treating Paco.

713
00:42:22,892 --> 00:42:24,403
Kid needs a real
father figure in his life,

714
00:42:24,427 --> 00:42:26,471
not some drunken asshole, you know?

715
00:42:36,806 --> 00:42:38,706
_

716
00:42:42,778 --> 00:42:45,755
That was nearly a week ago.

717
00:42:46,382 --> 00:42:48,193
It's been a whirlwind since then.

718
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:50,095
I thought I'd have to explain
my wounds to you,

719
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:52,397
but you didn't even notice.

720
00:42:52,421 --> 00:42:55,333
I suppose I can forgive you for that,

721
00:42:55,357 --> 00:42:58,203
what with your best friend dying and all.

722
00:42:58,227 --> 00:43:00,272
You did ask me to go
to the funeral with you,

723
00:43:00,296 --> 00:43:02,441
which I think is a good sign.

724
00:43:02,465 --> 00:43:04,109
You need emotional support right now,

725
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:06,111
and that's my specialty.

726
00:43:06,135 --> 00:43:08,346
So the fridge is fully stocked.

727
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:11,249
I grabbed a couple Xanax off Annika,

728
00:43:11,531 --> 00:43:13,752
just in case.

729
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:15,854
You're going to get through this.

730
00:43:15,878 --> 00:43:17,756
It'll take time.

731
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,791
But I'll give you
as much time as you need.

732
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:21,693
And I know once the dust settles,

733
00:43:21,717 --> 00:43:24,952
you will find
you're better off without her.

734
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:28,800
You might not ever admit this, of course.

735
00:43:28,824 --> 00:43:32,204
But I'll know, and that will
be all the validation I need.

736
00:43:32,228 --> 00:43:33,627
I'm gonna head out.

737
00:43:35,397 --> 00:43:37,598
Text me if you need anything, okay?

738
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:43,537
Okay.

739
00:43:47,614 --> 00:43:48,713
Joe?

740
00:43:50,112 --> 00:43:51,289
Yeah?

741
00:43:51,863 --> 00:43:53,647
Can you stay?

742
00:44:00,456 --> 00:44:02,752
I can stay as long as you want.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
